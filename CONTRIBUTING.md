## Bug Reports and Feature Suggestions

For all bug reports and feature suggestions, file an issue.

## New Features and Content

Open a pull request if you would like to contribute a new feature or other change to the codebase.

## Build Environment and Tests

Building and running tests depends on .Net Core. If you use Visual Studio 2017 with the .Net Core
tools installed you should be fine. The Magick.Net library used for generating images isn't currently
set up to work on Linux, but the steps to do so are explained here: https://github.com/dlemstra/Magick.NET/blob/master/Documentation/CrossPlatform.md
